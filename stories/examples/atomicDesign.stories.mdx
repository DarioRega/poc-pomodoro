## Atoms
Atoms are the smallest (universally agreed) components found within
a product or system. These usually include links, buttons, inputs, paragraphs, headings, icons, colours, and are used in combination with one another to construct molecules or organisms.


## Molecules
Molecules are a step up in size from atoms. They could include
navigation lists, input groups, text groups, and other structures which are made up of several atoms. The navigation list, for example, is made up for list items, links, text, and other small atoms, that when combined create the larger structures.

## Organisms
Organisms, are again another step up, larger than atoms and
molecules, they are a combination of either molecules or atoms and molecules. Organisms could include a hero banner, call to action section, footers, headers, forms and any large structures you find in a page.

## Templates
Templates are common layout patterns that you find across a
system. For example, a blog post would have a template, and so would a product page. These are pages with predefined layouts made up of organisms and molecules. Having predefined templates creates consistency and empowers the user to make use of your product

## Pages
Finally pages are the highest level concept of the methodology.
Pages are unique layouts that aren't necessarily repeated throughout your application. You may have a landing page that uses atoms, molecules and organisms in its construction but doesn't follow a predefined layout. This layout may include components in sequential order which don't follow a pre-determined order in your system
